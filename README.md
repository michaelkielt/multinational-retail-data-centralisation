## Description
The Multinational Retail Data Centralisation project is a powerful data management and preparation tool tailored for a massive retail organisation. 
This project addresses the complex task of consolidating data from various sources, including order details, product information, user details and store data.
It automates the critical processes of data extraction, cleaning, validation, and centralisation, making the data analysis pipeline smoother and more efficient.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Extraction:** The project includes specialized modules for retrieving data from diverse sources such as databases, PDF files, JSON files in S3 buckets,
  and APIs. The data is then transformed into Pandas DataFrames, the ideal format for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Data Cleaning and Validation:** With a suite of data cleaning and validation methods, this tool ensures that your data is in impeccable condition. Handle
  missing values, convert data types, and perform date formatting and regular expression pattern matching. This guarantees that your data is accurate, consistent,
  and ready for analysis.

- **Data Centralisation:** Bringing together data from multiple sources, the project consolidates it into a centralized Postgres database. This step ensures that
  all data is efficiently stored, easily accessible, and secure for future use.
